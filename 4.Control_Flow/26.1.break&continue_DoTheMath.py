# Problem:
'''
Youâ€™re making a calculator that should add multiple numbers taken from input and output the result.
The number of inputs is variable and should stop when the user enters "stop".
Sample Input:
4
32
6
stop
Sample Output:
42

Use an infinite loop to take user input and break it, if the input equals to "stop".

NOTE: Remember, the input is a string by default. You need to convert it to int to be able to use it as a number.

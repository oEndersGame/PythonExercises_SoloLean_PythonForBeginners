# Problem:
'''
Youâ€™re making a gold purity checker, that should accept only 22K or 24K gold. Only the good stuff!
22K gold has 91.7% or more gold in it, while 24K corresponds to 99.9% and above purity.
Given the % of gold purity as input, you should output "Accepted" only if it corresponds to 22 or 24K.
Sample Input:   93.4
Sample Output:  Accepted

NOTE:  Do not output anything if the gold corresponds to lower purity levels.

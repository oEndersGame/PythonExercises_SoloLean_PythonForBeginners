# Problem:
'''
Now that we know how to take user input, let's improve our contact card program that we previously made using variables.
Change the given code to take the name and age from user input and use them in the output.

NOTE: The input() function takes user input as a string.

# -----------------------------------------#

# CODE:

name = input()
age  = input()

print(name + " is "+age+" years old")

# Problem:
'''
Youâ€™re analyzing a data set and need to remove the outliers (the smallest and largest values.
The data is stored in a list).
Complete the code to remove the smallest and largest elements from the list and output the sum of the remaining numbers.

NOTE: Remember the functions a list supports: min and max can be used to get the smallest and largest numbers.

# CODE:

data = [7, 5, 6.9, 1, 8, 42, 33, 128, 1024, 2, 8, 11, 0.4, 1024, 66, 809, 11, 8.9, 1.1, 3.42, 9, 100, 444, 78]
#your code goes here:
data.remove(max(data))
data.remove(min(data))
print (sum(data))
